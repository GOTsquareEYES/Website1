                        <h1>Copper</h1>
                        <p>Copper was one of the first metals to be worked into implements and the first metal to be smelted from ores. Its excellent ductility and high conductivity assure its use in modern society.</p>

                        <h1>Desert Rose</h1>
                        <p>A (more or less) rose-like crystal group formed by precipitation in (usually) arid desert regions containing trapped sand particles. Usually, gypsum is the host mineral (Gypsum Rose), but baryte (Baryte Rose), celestine and other minerals can form Desert Rose groups, too.</p>

                        <h1>Graphite</h1>
                        <p>Graphite usually occurs in flakes in metamorphosed rocks rich in carbon, but it can also be found in veins and in pegmatites. Where large deposits are found, it is mined and used as an industrial lubricant and for 'lead' in pencils. The crystallinity depends on the temperature of the formation and the grade of metamorphism.</p>

                        <h1>Mercury</h1>
                        <p>Mercury is officially classed as a mineral species for historical reasons, and also because it is distinctive in its chemical and physical properties. However, because it occurs as a liquid, it does not satisfy the normal criteria to be a valid mineral. It crystallizes at -40 degrees celsius, at which point it forms rhombohedral crystals.</p>

                        <h1>Opal</h1>
                        <p>Although it is still (2007) regarded as a mineral species for historical reasons, opal is not a true mineral in the accepted sense of the word as it is variably composed of poorly crystalline material related to cristobalite and/or tridymite and/or composed of X-Ray amorphous silica. Commonly considered a mineraloid due to its amorphous nature, but more like a mixture due to its common but variable paracrystalline components.</p>
