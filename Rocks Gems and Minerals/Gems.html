                        <h1>Amethyst</h1>
                        <p>A violet to purple variety of quartz that owes its color to gamma irradiation (Berthelot, 1906) and the presence of traces of iron built into its crystal lattice (Holden, 1925). The irradiation causes the iron Fe(+3) atoms that replace Si in the lattice to lose an electron and form a [FeO4]0 color center (Lehmann and Moore, 1966).</p>

                        <h1>Diamond</h1>
                        <p>Diamond is the hardest natural substance known. It is formed deep in the mantle and is only brought to the surface via kimberlite pipes, lamprophyres, eclogites and other rocks that originate deep within the mantle. It is also found in alluvial deposits, along with quartz, corundum, zircon and other minerals, derived from such rocks, and in certain meteorites.</p>

                        <p>A green gem variety of beryl, highly sought after as a precious gemstone. The majority of the world's gem-quality emeralds come from the Muzo area of Colombia. The colour of emerald is caused by trace amounts of a chromophore such as trivalent chromium or trivalent vanadium.</p>

                        <p>A native element and precious metal, gold has long been prized for its beauty, resistance to chemical attack and workability. As it is found as a native element, has a relatively low melting point (1063 degrees Celsius) and is malleable, it has been used by mankind for thousands of years.</p>

                        <h1>Pearl</h1>
                        <p>A pearl is an organic mineral mixture formed with the soft living tissue of a shelled mollusk. Chemically pearls are made of calcium carbonate, either the mineral aragonite or a mixture of aragonite and calcite, sometimes also with minor vaterite. Pearls are used as gemstones but are not regarded as true minerals due to their organic origin. They can be cultured by inserting a seed into the mollusk.</p>
